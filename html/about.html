                While a lot of people were absent when the batch name was announced, because it was presumably made during quarantine, everyone absolutely loved the choice; it really fit the batch so well, which is probably why Alegre was chosen. Still, whoever chose it was right. Batch Alegre was always happy, and always joking no matter how stressful the situation was. Looking back before graduation, no one never really pinned down what the batch was known for, except being really competitive. That was a good thing, because they always used that feeling when answering exams or participating in contests. As for their sense of humor, it got to the point where even the teacher would be let in on their inside jokes, because they never really punched down on anyone. It was always light teasing and they enjoyed that.

The pandemic wasn't necessarily kind to them, but they remained the best versions of themselves from a couple feet away from a computer screen. It was still sad not to have the typical PSHS experience because of it, and a lot of them regret that. One of many regrets and just one of many factors.

Despite the ups and downs in the last six years, every Alegre member will cherish the sections war, the roleplays, and the jokes in between school requirements. And because of that, we thank you, Pisay, for uniting us and being the backdrop where we could create memories.
